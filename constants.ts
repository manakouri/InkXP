    // Mystery & Discovery
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "My fingers closed around a smooth, cool stone in the riverbed. It wasn't just any rock; it was pounamu, carved in a perfect spiral. As I lifted it out of the water, the stone grew strangely warm in my hand, and a deep, pulsing hum vibrated up my arm." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "The old bach at the end of the beach had been empty for years. But one night during a storm, I saw a light flickering in the window. I crept closer, wiped the salty spray from the glass, and peered inside. The room was empty, but sitting on the table was a single, steaming cup of tea." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "No one ever went into the old sports shed; Mr. Henderson kept it locked. But as I chased a stray netball, I saw the padlock was broken, lying on the grass. I nudged the door open with my foot, revealing a set of dusty stairs leading down into pure darkness." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "I was digging for pipi with my toes when my foot hit something hard and wooden. I dragged a small, locked box out of the wet sand. Inside, there wasn't gold, but a strange-looking compass with a needle that was spinning wildly." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "My nan always told me not to go near the giant pōhutukawa tree at the edge of the cliff, saying it was tapu. My rugby ball rolled right to its base, and when I reached down, I saw a small, carved face in the trunk. As I watched, its eyes blinked." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "A message in a bottle washed up at Lyall Bay. I unrolled the damp paper, expecting a call for help. Instead, it was a map of my school, with a big red 'X' marked right under the principal's office." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "My cat, Buster, brought in a 'bird', but it wasn't a sparrow or a fantail. It was tiny, bright blue, and had three wings. It wasn't dead, either—it chirped weakly, and the air around it started to shimmer." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "I found an old, brick-like mobile phone in the attic. I pressed the power button for a laugh, and it actually turned on. A second later, it vibrated with a new text message: 'We saw you. Stay hidden.'" },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "The new kid, Sam, never spoke to anyone. When he dropped his notebook running for the bus, I picked it up. I opened it to the first page and saw a perfect, detailed drawing of... me, sleeping in my bed last night." },
    { category: "Mystery & Discovery", text: "We were exploring the glow-worm caves with our torches. I turned mine off for just a second to see the 'stars' on the ceiling. When I clicked it back on, my family was gone, and a new tunnel, one I'd never seen before, had opened in the rock wall." },
    
    // Adventure & Action
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "'Stay on the track!' our teacher yelled. I just stepped off the path for a second to see a cool fungus. When I looked up, the rest of my school camp group had vanished. I called out, but the only reply was the call of a distant morepork, even though it was the middle of the day." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "The 'duck, cover, hold' drill was just another boring Thursday, until the rumble turned into a roar. The whole classroom shook violently. When the shaking finally stopped, we crawled out from under our desks. The door to the hallway was gone. There was just a solid brick wall." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "The rope swing over the river was my favourite. I grabbed the knot, ran, and launched myself into the air. But as I swung out, the world went strangely quiet and fuzzy. When I landed, I wasn't on the riverbank. I was in a forest where the trees were made of crystal." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "I was halfway across the paddock on my bike when the stray bull from the next farm spotted me. It lowered its head and started to charge. I pedalled as hard as I could, but the gumboot-sucking mud slowed me down. I glanced back, and the bull was gaining on me... fast." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "'Last one to the dairy is a rotten egg!' shouted Mia. We raced our scooters down the steep hill, flying past the letterboxes. I was winning, right until my front wheel hit a massive pothole. I flew over the handlebars, landed in a perfect forward roll, and stood up... right in the middle of a street from 100 years ago." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "I woke up to the sound of tapping on my window. It was just a pīwakawaka (fantail). I opened the window to shoo it away, but it flew inside, dropped a small, silver key on my pillow, and then spoke. 'You need to come now,' it chirped." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "We were on the observation deck of the Sky Tower, looking at the tiny cars below. Suddenly, the whole tower groaned and tilted to the side. A crack appeared in the thick glass floor right under my feet." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "The wave was a monster. I gripped my boogie board, but it was too late. It picked me up and hurled me under. I tumbled in the white water, and just when my lungs would burst, my head broke the surface. I wasn't in the ocean; I was in a small, round pond surrounded by giant, pulsating ferns." },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "I grabbed the rugby ball from the back of the scrum and ran. I dodged the first tackle, sidestepped the second, and sprinted for the try line. Just as I dived to score, the world dissolved into pixels. A digital voice said, 'Level 1 Complete. Initiating Level 2.'" },
    { category: "Adventure & Action", text: "'Whatever you do, don't open the shed,' Dad said as he left. Of course, the first thing I did was go to the shed. I pulled the door open, and standing in the middle of the tools was a full-sized moa, pecking at a bag of sheep nuts." },

    // Fantasy & Sci-Fi
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "My koro always told stories about the taniwha in the river. I thought he was just joking. But when I dropped my jandal in the water, a huge, scaly head with glowing red eyes rose from the rapids. It wasn't looking at my jandal; it was looking right at me." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "A bright light shone through my curtains. I looked outside, and a silver disc was hovering silently above our woolshed. A ramp lowered, and a creature that looked like a giant, upright wētā walked out." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "I bit into the sausage from the sausage sizzle. It tasted... weird. Everything started to spin, and when my vision cleared, I could understand what the seagulls squawking overhead were saying. They were all arguing about whose chip it was." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "My reflection in the puddle stared back at me. I waved, and it waved back. Then I stopped waving, but my reflection kept on waving. It smiled, a slow, creepy smile, and then put its hand up, pressing it against the surface of the water from the other side." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "The new neighbours moved in next door. I looked over the fence and saw them in their backyard, crouched on the grass and... eating rocks." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "I put on my togs for a swim. When I dived into the pool, I didn't get wet. The water parted around me like jelly. I took a deep breath... and I could breathe perfectly." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "I built a time machine out of an old washing machine for the science fair. I pressed the 'start' button as a joke. There was a flash, a smell of toast, and when I opened the door, a pūkeko wearing a tiny silver helmet poked its head in." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "My shadow peeled itself off the pavement. It stood up, stretched, and looked at me. 'Right,' it said in a dusty voice, 'I'm sick of following you. You follow me for a change.'" },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "I found a tuatara sitting on the Beehive in Wellington. I gently poked it, and its third eye, right in the middle of its forehead, snapped open and glowed a bright purple." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "The librarian gave me a book. 'This one is very overdue,' she whispered. I looked at the stamp inside. It said, 'Due Date: 12 June, 1886.'" },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "I planted the strange seed I found on the beach. The next morning, a vine had grown all the way up to my window. It had a single, huge, pulsating blue flower on it. As I watched, the flower began to open." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "Everything I drew in my art book suddenly started coming true. I drew a picture of me getting an ice cream, and Mum gave me $5. For my last drawing, I drew a dragon... and now I can hear a loud roaring sound coming from the rugby field." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "The lift at the library had a button for the 'Basement' that was always locked. My friend dared me to press it. The lift juddered, went down for a very long time, and opened into a cavern lit by glowing mushrooms." },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "I woke up, and my whole family was frozen in time. Dad was stuck mid-sneeze. The only thing moving was a tiny, green fantail, which landed on my shoulder and chirped, 'You have 10 minutes to fix it.'" },
    { category: "Fantasy & Sci-Fi", text: "The old computers in the school library were supposed to be broken. I sat at one and typed 'Hello' into a blank screen. The screen flickered, and a message typed itself back: 'We have been waiting for you.'" },

    // Real-Life & Emotional
    { category: "Real-Life & Emotional", text: "The moving van was packed. This was my last look at my old house. I waved goodbye to the pōhutukawa tree I used to climb and got in the car. As we drove past the dairy for the last time, I saw my best friend, Hemi, sprinting after the car, yelling and waving a small box I had never seen before." },
    { category: "Real-Life & Emotional", text: "I stood at the side of the stage, my heart hammering. It was the school kapa haka competition, and I was doing the solo. The music started, I stepped forward, and opened my mouth. But the voice that came out wasn't mine." },
    { category: "Real-Life & Emotional", text: "My dog, Buster, was old and hadn't run in years. But that morning, he was whining at the door, full of energy. I let him out, and he sprinted straight for the bush track. I ran after him until I came to a clearing, and saw him sitting next to a boy who looked exactly... like... me." },
    { category: "Real-Life & Emotional", text: "I'd been practicing my speech for weeks. I stood up in front of the class, took a deep breath, and looked at my notes. The words were gone. The page was completely blank, except for three words scribbled in red ink: 'Look behind you.'" },
    { category: "Real-Life & Emotional", text: "It was my birthday. My koro gave me a small, carved wooden box. 'This belonged to your great-great-grandmother,' he said. I opened it, and inside was a single, dusty seed. As I held it, the seed split open, and a bright green tendril snaked out and wrapped around my finger." }
